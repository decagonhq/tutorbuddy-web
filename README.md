# Authorization
There's no login authorization on the dashboard but i created a `userType` state in the `context/auth/AuthState.js` file.
Default value is `tutor`. You can also change it to `student`. Some similar pages are displayed depending on the userType e.g /dashboard, /rate/:id, Header component etc.

## Pages
All created pages can be found in the App.js file

## Uncompleted Pages

/profile
/reminder
/setreminder
/viewreminder

Pls check figma to align any leftover changes.
